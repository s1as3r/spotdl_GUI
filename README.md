This Script is a work in progress. </br>
It barely Works But Gets the job done.</br>
</br>
**:exclamation: Python 3.6+ Is required for the script to work.**

## Known Issues/Caveats:
**1.** Shows Download Complete dialog even if download wasn't able to complete.</br>
**2.** UI Freezes While Downloading. (Will fix this soon) </br>
**3.** UI is Pretty simple and looks like it's from the 90s.</br>
**4.** The log is displayed within the console.</br>
